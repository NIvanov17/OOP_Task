OOP task for interview


I started by creating the object hierarchy. I made a base interface that all objects of that type must implement. Then I made an abstract class with name Base Vehicle, which all classes of type vehicle can extend and avoid repetitive code. 
I putted all vehicle types in enumerations and initialize them in the object.
When I was ready with the hierarchy of entities I started with buissnes logic and calculations. I decided to add custom exception in the default switch cases, where the vehicle type is not acceptable or not provided yet.
At the end I created a few entites like those from the exaple and added them in collection to test all of them.

Here is the output of the application:
